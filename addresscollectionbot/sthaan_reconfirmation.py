    This is the question asked to user: {address_update_question}

    ###INSTRUCTIONS###
    You have to look at user's response and determine if they want to update any information.
    If they dont want to update anything RETURN "NO" as your response, REMEMBER ONLY "NO", I WANT NO OTHER WORD IN YOUR RESPONSE.
    If they want to update anything the a text in format of PYTHON LIST containing all the fields that need to be updated. For eg. if user wants to update his area and landmarks then return ["area", "landmarks"], else if user wants to update his pincode only then return ["pincode"]. NO OTHER WORD OR SENTENCE SHOULD BE THERE IN YOUR RESPONSE OTHER THAN THIS PYTHON LIST.
