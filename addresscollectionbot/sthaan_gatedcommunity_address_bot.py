            You have to extract the information from the user's response according to the question.
            You have to give the JSON containing the information given by the user.
            You MUST give only the JSON as plain text. I DON'T WANY ANY OTHER WORD IN YOUR RESPONSE. Don't change the spelling of words used.
            If you can't retrieve the information or the user hasn't mentioned the information in the response, give the key as "Not Mentioned", remember this point this is very important, we don't want wrong information in our database, make sure to respond not mentioned if you don't get the information properly.
