## Sthaan - Digital First Address for 7.8 Billion People

Imagine a world where locating a person or place is as simple as sending an email. Sthaan is a revolutionary virtual address platform that makes this possible. It's a digital, human-centric way of answering two fundamental questions: “Where are you?” and “How can I reach you?” with the help of a handle similar to a UPI Handle but to answer "Where" and "How"? For example: sita@paytm/home answers "Where is Sita's home?" and "How to reach her home?"

## Why Do We Need This?

### The Problems Caused by Unstructured Addresses:

- **Inefficiencies in Logistics:** Unstructured and incomplete addresses create significant inefficiencies in logistics, e-commerce, and essential services.
- **High Costs:** The lack of standardized addresses leads to higher costs for businesses, with billions lost annually.
- **Data Privacy Issues:** Users have limited control over how their sensitive address data is shared and used.
