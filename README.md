## About Sthan - Collective Hope/ Dream
Imagine a world where every location is easily accessible, where addresses are structured, standardized, and secure.
Sthan is not just about improving addressing systems, it's about empowering people with privacy and control over their location data. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds, making it easier for individuals and businesses to connect, regardless of where they are by introducing a digital protocol for creating privacy-protecting, interoperable, and consent-driven addresses. 

This initiative seeks to address the challenges faced by billions of people worldwide due to unstructured or inadequate addressing systems, particularly in developing nations.
By leveraging modern technology, Sthan introduces a novel approach to both reaching and resolving physical locations digitally, offering a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly method for address management.

## Problem Statement/ Hypothesis

<img width="832" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PeoplePlusAI/Sthan/assets/151424479/3c329671-4984-47c3-bbcf-a49a04c8fc4c">


Our hypothesis is two fold:

1. The address problem: Indian addresses are often non-standard, unstructured, and incomplete, which creates significant inefficiencies for logistics, e-commerce, and essential services. Users also lack control over how their sensitive address data is shared and used.
2. The solution and incentives: There is a need for a new standard that virtualizes physical addresses, empowering users with privacy and control. This standardization needs a system of incentives to encourage:

Adoption: Investment in the Sthan infrastructure to enhance reliability and coverage.
Participation: Active use of Sthan addresses by individuals and businesses for smoother deliveries and transactions.
