## Sthaan - An Easier Way to Reach People

Aadhaar and UPI are two well-known systems in India that provide virtual addresses for specific purposes:

Aadhaar answers: "Who are you?" (your virtual identity).
UPI ID answers: "Where do I pay you?" (your virtual payment address).

Sthaan answers: "Where are you?" and "How do I reach you?" 

## Why Do We Need This?

**India loses $10-14 billion annually due to unstructured addresses or lack of addresses,making it difficult to reach people [[Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323164874_Economic_Impact_of_Discoverability_of_Localities_and_Addresses_in_India)].**
