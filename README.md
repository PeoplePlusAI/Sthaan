# Sthaan - Digital First Address for 7.8Bn People

"Sthaan" is a virtual address protocol that simplifies locating a person or a physical space.

## The problem

To solve this problem, we are building "Sthaan". 

* Indian addresses are often non-standard, unstructured, and incomplete. 
* Which creates significant inefficiencies for logistics, e-commerce, and essential services. 
* Users also lack control over how their sensitive address data is shared and used.

## The solution  

Imagine a world where every location is easily accessible and addresses are structured, standardized, and secure. Sthaan is not just about improving addressing systems, it's about empowering people with privacy and control over their location data and enabling Logistic Players to reduce the cost of last-mile delivery and help businesses to expand to underserved territories. 

* Sthaan is a digitally native way of answering “Where are you?” in the most human-centric, and simplified way! 
* Our goal is to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds, making it easier for individuals and businesses to connect, regardless of where they are. 
* We are doing this by introducing a digital protocol for creating privacy-protecting, interoperable, and consent-driven addresses.

This standardization needs a system of incentives to encourage:
1. Adoption - Investment in the Sthaan infrastructure to enhance reliability and coverage.
2. Participation - Active use of Sthaan addresses by individuals and businesses for smoother deliveries and transactions.

## Next Commitments

We are looking for enthusiastic volunteers who can own pieces of this design puzzle. 

if you have expertise and/or interest in:
1. **Business Case Development**: Help us understand the pain points of logistics players, sellers, and buyers. Identify use cases and early adopters of Sthaan.
2. **Technical Architecture**: Contribute to designing a system that delivers a positive user experience.
3. **Policy Development:** As we aim to make Sthaan a benchmark in its domain, developing a robust policy framework is essential. We need volunteers who can help craft policies that ensure compliance, ethical standards, and user protection. Your knowledge in legal, regulatory, or policy writing will guide Sthaan towards sustainable and responsible growth.
