## Collective Hope/ Dream
Sthan aims to revolutionize the way we think about and use physical addresses by introducing a digital protocol for creating privacy-protecting, interoperable, and consent-driven addresses. 
This initiative seeks to address the challenges faced by billions of people worldwide due to unstructured or inadequate addressing systems, particularly in developing nations.
By leveraging modern technology, Sthan introduces a novel approach to both reaching and resolving physical locations digitally, offering a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly method for address management.

## Problem Statement/ Hypothesis

<img width="832" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PeoplePlusAI/Sthan/assets/151424479/3c329671-4984-47c3-bbcf-a49a04c8fc4c">


Our hypothesis is two fold:

1. The address problem: Indian addresses are often non-standard, unstructured, and incomplete, which creates significant inefficiencies for logistics, e-commerce, and essential services. Users also lack control over how their sensitive address data is shared and used.
2. The solution and incentives: There is a need for a new standard that virtualizes physical addresses, empowering users with privacy and control. This standardization needs a system of incentives to encourage:

Adoption: Investment in the Sthan infrastructure to enhance reliability and coverage.
Participation: Active use of Sthan addresses by individuals and businesses for smoother deliveries and transactions.

## Next Commitments

We are looking for enthusiastic volunteers who can own pieces of this design puzzle. Please reach out to sreeram@peopleplus.ai if you have expertise and/or interest to:
1. Establish a strong business case for an Sthan Protocol: (a) Understand pain points that existing Logistics Players, Sellers and Buyers face. (b) Identify use cases and applications that could be early adopters of this network. (c) Identify incentive schemes that lower the barrier for providers and customers to join this network.
2. Give feedback and contribute to designing the technical architecture that gives a positive NPS experience.
